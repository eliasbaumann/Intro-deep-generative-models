# Introduction to deep generative models
This work was done for a seminar on machine learning for statisticians. My assigned topic was deep generative models. The seminar paper and all code written for the paper can be found in this repository. This work happened entirely in self-study, code will not be efficient and also not be optimal as the goal of this work is to understand generative models and their workings as well as issues.

I do not think the paper includes any sort of contribution to actual research, therefore i will not submit it to arxiv. If you find this repository and make use of any information from my paper, feel free to instead quote the original works instead of mine.

The ipython notebook can also be found on google colab where all computations have been done as well:
